# Implementation Plan for Digital Circuit Simulator and 8-bit CPU Emulator

This plan outlines the steps to build a C# program that simulates digital sequential circuits using logic gates, includes a DSL for circuit definition, visualization, save/load functionality, and ultimately emulates a simple 8-bit CPU.

## Checklist

- [x] **Implement Logic Gates**
  - Design and implement classes for logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) with input/output handling

- [x] **Unit Tests for Logic Gates**
  - Create unit tests for all logic gate classes to verify correct output for various inputs

- [x] **Design Circuit Structure**
  - Create a Circuit class to manage gates, connections, and sequential logic (flip-flops, etc.)

- [x] **Unit Tests for Circuit Structure**
  - Create unit tests for Circuit class to verify gate connections and sequential behavior

- [x] **Build Simulation Engine**
  - Implement tick-by-tick simulation engine that propagates signals through the circuit

- [x] **Unit Tests for Simulation Engine**
  - Create unit tests for simulation engine to verify signal propagation and timing

- [x] **Create DSL Parser**
  - Design and implement a DSL parser to define circuit structures and connections from text input

- [x] **Unit Tests for DSL Parser**
  - Create unit tests for DSL parser to verify parsing of valid and invalid DSL inputs

- [ ] **Implement Save/Load**
  - Add functionality to save circuit definitions to files and load them back

- [ ] **Unit Tests for Save/Load**
  - Create unit tests for save/load functionality to verify file I/O and data integrity

- [ ] **Build Circuit Visualization**
  - Create a text-based visualization that displays the circuit diagram and state at each tick

- [ ] **Unit Tests for Circuit Visualization**
  - Create unit tests for visualization to verify output formatting and state display

- [ ] **Create Simulation Wrapper**
  - Build a wrapper program that takes DSL input, simulates the circuit, and outputs state tables

- [ ] **Unit Tests for Simulation Wrapper**
  - Create unit tests for simulation wrapper to verify end-to-end simulation and output

## Notes
- The 8-bit CPU emulation is the overall goal, achieved by completing all prior tasks.
- Each implementation task is followed by its unit tests to ensure quality.
- Use C# as the implementation language.
- Start with logic gates and progress sequentially.
