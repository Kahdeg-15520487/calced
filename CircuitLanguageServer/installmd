Install the packaging tool:
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
Package the extension:
cd CircuitLanguageServer
vsce package
This creates a .vsix file (e.g., circuit-language-server-0.0.1.vsix)

Install in VS Code:

Open VS Code
Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
Select the .vsix file you just created
Option 2: Run in Development Mode (For Testing/Development)
Open the extension folder in VS Code:

Press F5 or go to Run & Debug panel and select "Launch Extension"

This opens a new VS Code window with your extension loaded
Any .circuit files will now have syntax highlighting, diagnostics, and completion
Option 3: Manual Installation (Alternative)
If you prefer not to use vsce, you can also:

Copy the entire CircuitLanguageServer folder to ~/.vscode/extensions/ (Linux/Mac) or %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\ (Windows)
Restart VS Code
